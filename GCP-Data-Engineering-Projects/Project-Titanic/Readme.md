# 01 Project Titanic
This project is based on the legendary Titanic ML competition, which serves as an excellent starting point for diving into machine learning competitions and getting familiar with the Kaggle platform. The competition’s objective is straightforward: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. With only a limited number of lifeboats available, 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew lost their lives. This challenge involves building a predictive model to answer the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. For more details and to join the competition, visit the Kaggle platform and check out Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial for a step-by-step guide on making your first submission.
