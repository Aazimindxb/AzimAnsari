Currently pursuing the Google Data Engineer Certification. I’m passionate about turning data into insights, building scalable data pipelines, managing large datasets with ETL processes, and working with cloud data services.  

I am resourceful, inquisitive, and highly motivated to create real-world business value. Integrity and honesty are my top priorities, and I am looking for a remote position that will allow me to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of the company.

I’m a dedicated and hard-working person who learns quickly and adapts to new technologies. I look forward to connecting with others in the data engineering community and growing together!
